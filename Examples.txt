I created two new contacts:
	network-primary
	network-secondary
	
I set the host and service notification commands on both contacts to the new commands I created during install
	
I created multiple new contact groups
	network-all
	network-boss
	
I add everyone who will ever be on call for network equipment to the network-all group.

On all network equipment on the alert settings I set the contact to equal network-primary and set notification interval to 15 mins

I create a service and host escalation, both tied to the same hostgroup that esclates to network_secondary on the 2nd alert and also sets second as the last alert

Because of the above escalation, I modify the scripts and set the $alertnum variable to 3.  If I did not, starting with the 3rd alert the primary on-call would receive duplicate alerts

I create a service and host escalation, both tied to the same hostgroup that esclates to network_all on the 3rd alert and sets final notification to 0

I create a service and host escalation, both tied to the same hostgroup that esclates to network_boss on the 4th alert and sets final notification to 0
